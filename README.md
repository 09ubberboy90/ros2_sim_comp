# ros2_sim_comp
Most robotics research uses simulation software. However finding which one to use for a specific use is complex. This is why this repository provides an extensive set of test to provide a systematic review of 5 simulation software: PyBullet, Coppeliasim (VREP), Webots, Ignition, Isaac Sim. This is based on ROS2 Foxy
